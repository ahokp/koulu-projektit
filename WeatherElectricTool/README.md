# Building the application

The application requires Qt 5, Qt Charts 5 and Qt XML 5 to build and run.
Qt Creator 5.14 is also required to open the project files and build
them. OpenSSH is required to fetch API data, but the program will build and
start without it. The TUNI Linux remote desktop is able to build and run the
software correctly without any extra installations.

To build the entire application, open
WeatherElectricMain/WeatherElectricMain.pro in Qt Creator and press Run
from the sidebar. The program will then build and run, displaying a
single window. Use the Add New Graph-button to add a new data source and begin
using the program.
